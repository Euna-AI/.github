# Euna AI

Euna Solutions is committed to empowering the public sector. We're a group of people who care deeply about the work governments and public sector agencies do. We strive to make their work easier and more impactful. 

Euna designs, builds, delivers, and supports SaaS solutions for the public sector. We help agencies manage things like budgets, procurement, grants, payments, and financial operations.

The three core focus areas of the Euna AI team are AI Enablement, AI Engineering, and SDLC efficiency.
